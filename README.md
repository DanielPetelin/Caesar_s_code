<h1>Caesar's cipher!</h1>
<p>The Caesar cipher, also known as the shift cipher, Caesar code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption methods.</p>
<p>The Caesar cipher is a kind of substitution cipher in which each character in the plaintext is replaced by a character located at some constant number of positions to the left or right of it in the alphabet. For example, in a cipher with a shift to the right by 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become D, and so on.</p>
<p>The code is named after the Roman general Gaius Julius Caesar, who used it for secret correspondence with his generals.</p>
<p>The cipher step performed by the Caesar cipher is often included as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenere cipher, and still has a modern application in the ROT13 system. Like all mono-alphabetic ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and has almost no practical use.</p>
